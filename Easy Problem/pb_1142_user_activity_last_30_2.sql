Table: Activity

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| user_id       | int     |
| session_id    | int     |
| activity_date | date    |
| activity_type | enum    |
+---------------+---------+
There is no primary key for this table, it may have duplicate rows.
The activity_type column is an ENUM of type ('open_session', 'end_session', 'scroll_down', 'send_message').
The table shows the user activities for a social media website.
Note that each session belongs to exactly one user.


Write an SQL query to find the average number of sessions per user for a period of 30 days
ending 2019-07-27 inclusively, rounded to 2 decimal places.
The sessions we want to count for a user are those with at least
one activity in that time period.

The query result format is in the following example:

Activity table:
+---------+------------+---------------+---------------+
| user_id | session_id | activity_date | activity_type |
+---------+------------+---------------+---------------+
| 1       | 1          | 2019-07-20    | open_session  |
| 1       | 1          | 2019-07-20    | scroll_down   |
| 1       | 1          | 2019-07-20    | end_session   |
| 2       | 4          | 2019-07-20    | open_session  |
| 2       | 4          | 2019-07-21    | send_message  |
| 2       | 4          | 2019-07-21    | end_session   |
| 3       | 2          | 2019-07-21    | open_session  |
| 3       | 2          | 2019-07-21    | send_message  |
| 3       | 2          | 2019-07-21    | end_session   |
| 3       | 5          | 2019-07-21    | open_session  |
| 3       | 5          | 2019-07-21    | scroll_down   |
| 3       | 5          | 2019-07-21    | end_session   |
| 4       | 3          | 2019-06-25    | open_session  |
| 4       | 3          | 2019-06-25    | end_session   |
+---------+------------+---------------+---------------+

Result table:
+---------------------------+
| average_sessions_per_user |
+---------------------------+
| 1.33                      |
+---------------------------+
User 1 and 2 each had 1 session in the past 30 days while user 3
had 2 sessions so the average is (1 + 1 + 2) / 3 = 1.33.

# My Solution

select
  coalesce(round((count(distinct session_id)/count(distinct user_id)),2),0.00000) as average_sessions_per_user
from activity
where datediff('2019-07-27',activity_date)<30;

#2nd Solution:
select round(ifnull(avg(cnt),0),2) as average_sessions_per_user
from(
select user_id, count(distinct session_id) as cnt
from activity
where activity_date > date_sub('2019-07-27', interval 30 day)
group by user_id) T
